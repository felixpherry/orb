# The Record

A curated list of factual, scoped statements asserting the application's **current** state. Authoritative for the present, never the future.

The planner consults this file before proposing a plan. If a feature **contradicts** an entry here, the contradiction is surfaced before the plan proceeds. If a feature **establishes a new high-level fact**, a verbatim entry is proposed for human approval as part of the plan.

## Format Rules

- **Factual.** Assert how things are _now_. Never future intent ("we will...", "should..."). Each entry is the current state of the application.
- **Scoped.** Name what each entry applies to — repo, app, frontend, or a named subsystem. An unscoped fact (e.g. "uses Fossil") is ambiguous: is that the repo, or the app's supported VCS list? Always disambiguate.
- **High-level.** One-liners (a few sentences at most). Capture decisions and facts a planner needs, not implementation minutiae.
- **Single tag.** Each entry carries exactly one subsystem tag as a `(tag)` prefix: `- (tools) The bash tool runs...`. One entry, one tag — this keeps tag usage a meaningful coverage metric (a tag growing large signals over-specification or a tag that should split). If you cannot decide between two tags for an entry, that is a signal to **re-evaluate the entry itself**, not to assign both. Use `(tag)` rather than `[tag]` to avoid colliding with markdown task-list (checkbox) syntax.
- **Singular concept.** Each entry should be a single sentence and only concerned with a single concept. Prefer multiple entries versus combining many things into one.

## Templates

| Pattern     | Form                                                             | Example                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State       | `[Scope] currently [does X / is Y].`                             | "The TUI's first screen at startup is the chat screen."                                 |
| Persistence | `[Scope] persists [what] to [where].`                            | "Sessions persist to SQLite."                                                           |
| Flow        | `[Input/event] is handled by [actor/subsystem], which [action].` | "File edits route through the `edit` tool, which requires a unique match or `replace_all`."        |
| Boundary    | `[Scope] is bounded by [constraint].`                            | "Project discovery walks ancestors until a VCS root or `$HOME`, whichever comes first." |

## Absence

A missing record, or an un-recorded area, simply means the list has no entry there yet. Absence is not a constraint — it is an open question, and a feature that fills a gap may establish the first entry for that area (proposed for human approval as part of the plan).

## Editing

Entries are added or amended **only with human approval**.

---

- (keybinds) Plain `q` in Normal mode quits orb.
- (keybinds) orb has no `:` command line.
- (pane) The terminal pane runs its child in a PTY (`portable-pty`) emulated by `alacritty_terminal` and drawn cell by cell into the ratatui buffer.
- (pane) orb redraws when input, PTY output, or child exit wakes the loop; there is no fixed tick or frame throttle.
- (pane) While attached, keys, paste, mouse, and focus events are encoded for the child's current terminal modes and written straight to the PTY, bypassing the `IntentHandler`.
- (pane) The pane's child runs with `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor`, `TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SYNC_OUTPUT=1`, with Claude session variables and the outer terminal's identity variables removed.
- (pane) orb captures the mouse only while attached and forwards the child's OSC 52 clipboard writes to its outer terminal.
- (cli) `orb -- <cmd…>` sets the command the terminal pane runs.
- (keybinds) `⏎` in Normal mode attaches to the terminal pane; without a pane command it does nothing.
- (keybinds) While attached, every key goes to the child except `<C-\>`, which returns to Normal mode.
