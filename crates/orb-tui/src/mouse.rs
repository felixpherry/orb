//! The mouse in orb's own UI: a click on the sidebar moves the keys there,
//! a click on a row selects it and a double-click attaches, and a click on
//! the sidebar's input box starts a search. A click on a tab in the tab bar,
//! or on a chip counting hidden tabs, shows that tab with the keys in its
//! focused pane, and a click on its `+` opens a tab; the wheel over the bar
//! shows the next tab on a scroll up and the previous on a scroll down. A
//! click on a row of a stack's list focuses its pane, and the wheel over the
//! list shows the next stacked pane on a scroll down and the previous on a
//! scroll up, leaving the keys where they are. The pane frames and the start
//! screen take no clicks. The wheel over the sidebar scrolls its view and
//! never moves the selection, wherever the keys are. In a
//! picker a click selects a row, a double-click picks it and the wheel over
//! its list moves the selection; a click outside a picker or the rename box
//! closes it like `Esc`. A click in the text of the sidebar search, a
//! picker's input or the rename box moves its cursor there.
//!
//! The wheel over any pane goes to its program
//! while the program reads the mouse, sends arrow keys while it's on the
//! alternate screen, and otherwise scrolls the pane's history. A left press
//! on the focused pane goes to its program while it reads the mouse, and
//! otherwise starts a selection that the drag extends and the release
//! copies. A press on another pane focuses it without reaching its program,
//! and starts a selection there unless its program reads the mouse. The
//! press decides who gets the drag and the release that follow it.
//!
//! Each frame records where it drew what a click can land on, and a mouse
//! event is mapped back through that record.
